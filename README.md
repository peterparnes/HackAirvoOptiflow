# Hack for Airvo Optiflow

This repository is for a replacement pipe for the Airvo Optiflow for COVID19 health care. During the COVID19 pandemy there is a big lack of replacement pipes for the Airvo Optiflow as they are normally not reused. 

The replacement part has been designed and protyped at Luleå University of Technology together with medical professionals at Region Norrbotten and Sunderby hospital in Luleå, Sweden.
