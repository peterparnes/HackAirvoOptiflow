# Hack for Airvo Optiflow

This repository is for a replacement pipe for the Airvo Optiflow for COVID19 health care. During the COVID19 pandemy there is a big lack of replacement pipes for the Airvo Optiflow as they are normally not reused. 

These parts are only to be used during the COVID19 pandemy. 

The pipes need to be printed in a clinical environment on a clean SLA/SLS machine using medically approved meaterial. E.g. the Formlabs 2, 3 or 3B using Surgical Guide or Dental LT resin. 

The replacement part has been designed and protyped at Luleå University of Technology together with medical professionals at Region Norrbotten and Sunderby hospital in Luleå, Sweden.
